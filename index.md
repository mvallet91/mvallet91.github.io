My name is Manuel Valle Torre, check my [CV](/assets/MVT_CV.pdf) for the formal stuff. 

I've always been interested in the newest technologies and their application, that's why I chose a bachelor that focuses on the use of technologies like Information Systems for purposes such as Business. Later I decided I needed a stronger technical base which lead to studying a Computer Science master in TU Delft.

My (work) interest is in the world of Data (*Engineering, Analytics and Science*) and how it impacts our Learning processes through Analytics and Feedback. 
Currently I have the privilege of doing this in the Web Information Systems ([WIS](https://www.tudelft.nl/en/eemcs/the-faculty/departments/software-technology/web-information-systems)) group and the Centre for Education and Learning ([CEL](https://www.educationandlearning.nl/home)), everyday learning about learning.

I enjoy music, travelling, cooking, cycling, beer and mezcal - especially when combined and shared. 
Always ready for a challenge and eager to learn new things, nowadays this is Learning Psychology, yoga and making my own [hot sauces](https://mvallet91.github.io/sauces).
