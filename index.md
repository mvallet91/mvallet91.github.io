Hi ðŸ‘‹ I'm Manuel, you can check my [CV](/assets/MVT_CV.pdf) for the formal stuff. 

I've always been interested in the newest technologies and their application, that's why I did my Bachelor's on Business Informatics, which focused on the use of technology and information systems for organizations and business. Later I decided I needed a stronger technical base which lead to studying a Computer Science Master in TU Delft.

My work interest is in the world of Data *Engineering, Analytics and Science* and how it impacts the (human) learning processes through Analytics and Feedback. 
I had the privilege of working at the Web Information Systems ([WIS](https://www.tudelft.nl/en/eemcs/the-faculty/departments/software-technology/web-information-systems)) group as a Research Engineer for a couple of years, where I discovered my interest in Learning Analytics.
Now I continue as a PhD in the Centre for Education and Learning ([CEL](https://www.educationandlearning.nl/home)), everyday learning about learning, and how can we use data and analytics to support this process.

I enjoy music, travelling, cooking, cycling, beer and mezcal - especially when combined and shared. 
Always ready for a challenge and eager to learn new things, nowadays this is Cognitive Psychology, yoga and making my own [hot sauces](https://mvallet91.github.io/sauces).
