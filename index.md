Hi ðŸ‘‹ I'm Manuel, you can check my [CV](/assets/MVT_CV.pdf) for the formal stuff. 

I've always been interested in the newest technologies and their application, that's why I did my Bachelor's on Business Informatics, which focused on the use of technology and  information systems for organizations and business. Later I decided I needed a stronger technical base which lead to studying a Computer Science Master in TU Delft.

My (work) interest is in the world of Data (*Engineering, Analytics and Science*) and what we can learn from it.
For the past 3 years, I've had the privilege of doing this in the Web Information Systems ([WIS](https://www.tudelft.nl/en/eemcs/the-faculty/departments/software-technology/web-information-systems)) group and the Centre for Education and Learning ([CEL](https://www.educationandlearning.nl/home)). 
Lately I've become more and more interested in how data can explain and improve *how we learn*, so now I'm a PhD student in the field of Learning Analytics, Self-Regulated Learning, and more!

I enjoy music, travelling, cooking, cycling, beer and mezcal - especially when combined and shared. 
Always ready for a challenge and eager to learn new things, nowadays this is Educational Psychology, yoga and making my own [hot sauces](https://mvallet91.github.io/sauces).
