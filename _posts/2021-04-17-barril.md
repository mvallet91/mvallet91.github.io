Big change in life, like starting a PhD, is pretty scary...salsa roja is nice and comforting, see where I'm going with this?
Salsa roja goes on everything, you can have it cold or warm right out of the pan.
I made this one with fermented peppers to add a bit of funk, but fresh peppers will be just as delicious!
The recipe below is more of a loose guide, feel free to change proportions and methods as you want, it will be delicious no matter what. 

### Ingredients:
- 5-6 roma tomatoes
- 2 medium yellow onions
- 2 chipotle peppers
- Ají amarillo or habanero peppers (can be 1 or 10, depending on how hot you want it)
- 2 dried guajillo peppers
- Salt, pepper, lime juice and oregano to taste
- Cooking oil (like sunflower or regular olive oil)

### Instructions:
1. Preheat the oven to 180 C
2. Cut the tomatoes and onions in half and place them on an oven tray
You could do this on a barbecue, just leave everything whole!  
3. Bake/grill until the skin of the tomatoes is curling, and the edges of the onions are charring
4. Get everything out of the heat and let it sit for a few minutes
5. In the meantime: toast the guajillos in a pan on medium heat, or directly on the fire, until they start inflating
6. Blend everything together to the desired consistency, or use a molcajete!
7. Heat some oil in a sauce pan 
8. Fry the sauce for a minute, then turn down the heat to low
9. Simmer for 15 minutes
10. Fix salt & pepper to taste (you can even sprinkle some sugar to bring the flavors together)
