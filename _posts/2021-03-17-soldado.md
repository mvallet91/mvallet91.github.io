Straightforward: spicy, tangy and salty - all you need to know about this sauce is right on the first bite. 
Charring the serranos brings the sweetness almost down to zero and it adds a smokey touch to bring it all together.

### Ingredients:
- 500 grams fresh serrano peppers
- 1/4 cup lime juice
- 1/4 cup Maggi seasoning sauce
- Freshly ground black pepper to taste
- Olive oil

### Instructions:
1. Arrange all the serranos in a heavy pan
2. Heat the pan on medium-high until the serranos start lightly popping
3. Bring the heat down to medium 
4. Keep turning and roasting the peppers until blackened, might take 30 minutes or so
5. Remove from the pan and pull the stems out
6. Blend the charred peppers with the lime juice and **half** of the Maggi
7. Add Maggi and pepper to taste
8. (Optional) Add a tablespoon of olive oil and blend again until creamy (or emulsified)
