My name is Manuel Valle Torre, check my [CV](/assets/MVT_CV.pdf) for the formal stuff. 

I've always been interested in the newest technologies and their application, that's why I chose a bachelor that focuses on the use of technologies like Information Systems for purposes such as Business. Later I decided I needed a stronger technical base which lead to studying a Computer Science master in TU Delft.

My (work) interest is in the world of Data Engineering, Analytics and Science. Currently I have the privilege of doing this in the Web Information Systems group and the Centre for Education and Learning, everyday learning about learning.

I enjoy music, travelling, cooking, cycling, beer and mezcal (and all their combinations!). Always ready for a challenge and eager to learn new things, nowadays this is yoga, making fermented hot sauce, and MLOps.
